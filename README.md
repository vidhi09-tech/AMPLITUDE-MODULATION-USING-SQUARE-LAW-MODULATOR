# AMPLITUDE-MODULATION-USING-SQUARE-LAW-MODULATOR
Generation of an AM signal by a square law modulator and verifying the signal power of a received signal, which has undergone with amplitude modulation at the transmitter and mixed with an AWGN of zero mean and 0.2 variance during transmission.

This code is divided into 4 sub parts:
•	Generate message and carrier signal

•	Amplitude modulation using carrier square law demodulator

•	Noise addition

•	Demodulation of the transmitted signal
